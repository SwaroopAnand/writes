                4 main learnings
                <ul>
                  <li>Incremental changes are the safe path</li>
                  <li>
                    Lean and Flexible
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Planning is being arrogant, startups should stay
                        flexible and lean. Make incremental changes, experiment
                        and align course accordingly.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Improve on competition
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Small startups should not try to create new markets from
                        the ground up, instead focus on making improvements on
                        established markets.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Product is more important than sales
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Technology is more about product than sales, so focus on
                        your product. If you product cant sell itself, it's not
                        good enough. Dot com companies spent so much money on
                        advertising, only viral effects are worth the money
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Right after listing the 4 learnings, Thiel plays devil's
                advocate and says entrepreurs and investors took the wrong
                learnings from the dot com bubble. Thiel's learnings are as
                follows:
              </li>
              <li>
                Thiels 4 learning
                <ul>
                  <li>It is better to risk boldness than triviality.</li>
                  <li>A bad plan is better than no plan</li>
                  <li>Competitive markets destroy profits</li>
                  <li>Sales matter as much as product</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Obviously neither set of learnings are entirely right or wrong.
                Thiel wants the reader to think for themselves, reactions to
                past mistakes can be as wrong as the mistakes made. Stay
                pragmatic and don't be afraid of being labeled as contrarian.

              <li>
                The reality is, there is no perfect competition, competition
                eats away from the same pool of potential profits. In a market
                with perfect competition, nobody makes any money.

                Monopoly vs non-monopoly
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Non-monopolist exaggerate their uniqueness by describing
                    their target market as the intersection of various smaller
                    markets.

                  <li>
                    In contrast, monopolist disguise their monopoly status by
                    describing their target market as the union of large
                    sectors.

            Ideology of Competition - Vicious circle continues
            <ul>
              <li>
                It's not only the economists that are fooled by competition, our
                society is driven by it!
              </li>
              <li>
                Bright students at a young age start competing for admissions to
                elite institutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once they reach there, competition intensifies now the target is
                to land that management consulting, investment banking or
                blue-chip engineering position.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once they land at those prestigious jobs, competition reaches
                new highs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lesson here is that, competition is WAR, and war is a costly
                business both in terms of time and resources. War should be
                avoided if it's not worth it. In the case that war is worth
                having, then you should strike hard and end it quickly. There
                are no half measures in war.

              <li>
                Escaping competition is the first step to building a monopoly,
                but it should be defensible.

                When evaluating fast-growing small companies ask this question:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Will this business still be around a decade from now?

                Characteristics of a Monopoly
                <ul>

                    10X changes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    2.Network Effects -
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        As the number of users increase, it makes the product as
                        a whole more valuable.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ironically, in order to leverage network effects you
                        need to focus on a small target demographics " a niche"

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Firms get stronger as sales grow because fixed costs can
                        be spread over a larger quantity of sales
                      </li>
                      <li>Software vs service businesses</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    4. Branding
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Every company has a divine right to monopoly with their
                        branding. A strong branding is a powerful way to obtain
                        monopoly.

                  <li></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                So how do you build a monopoly? #Question
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Start with a small, well-defined target demographics which
                    is clustered in samll geographical area.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is easire to start with a small target audience rather
                    than a large market.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Large markets comes with cut-throat competition, remember
                    what we said about competition in the last chapter?

                Thiel advocates for the definite optimism. That's how great
                companies will be built. Instead of pursuing many-sided
                mediocrity and calling it "well-roundedness", definite optimist
                strives to be great at something substantive -- to be a monopoly
                of one.

                Every great busiess is built around a secret that's hidden from
                the outside. Inner workings of Google's PageRank algorithm,

                    Conflicts at startups usually stems from misalignment at 3
                    important dimensions, these are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Ownership who legally owns company's equity. (founders,
                        employees and investors)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Possession who controls day to day operations of the
                        company. (founders and employees)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Control who formally govern company's affairs. (board of

                  <li>
                    Make sure each party involved with your startup in one way
                    or another is adequately represented.

                Boardroom of a Startup - less is more.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Smaller the board, easier it is for directors to
                    communicate, reach consensus and to exercise oversight.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    However, the very effective nature of a small board also
                    means that board can oppose management quite easily.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When assembling a small board, you need to pick your
                    directors carefully. Each director matters, and even one can
                    give you a lot of headache and jeopardize company's future.
                  </li>
                  <li>A board of 3 is ideal for private companies.</li>
                  <li>
                    If you want to rein freely in a dictatorial style, bloat
                    your board to a massive size which will give you full
                    autonomy. If you want to have an effective board, keep it
                    small!

                    Anyone who doesn't own stock options but regularly draws
                    down salary is MISALIGNED. Their motive would be to extract
                    as much value from the company rather than creating value.

                        Personal Note: Thiel advocates that everyone at a
                        startup should be full-time and strictly no remote
                        working, but I think times have changed and remote work
                        is perfectly feasible. Furthermore employees would
                        apprecitate a better work/life balance rather than
                        mindless pursuit of capital gain.

                Cash is NOT King
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    High CEO pay encourages CEO to behave like a politician so
                    she can hold on the entitlement longer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cash encourages short term thinking rather than long term
                    value creation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    So cash incentives and bonuses should be avoided where
                    possible. Equity is the best way to keep everyone aligned
                    for long term vision.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    CEO should also set an example either by taking the LOWEST
                    salary or taking the highest but still a MODEST salary. Good
                    CEOs lead by example.

            The Mechanics of Mafia
            <ul>
              <li>
                Early PayPal team is known as the PayPal mafia Valley because
                members of this early team went on to create many succesful
                companies such as YouTube, Palantir, Tesla, LinkedIn, Yelp and
                invested in many others. What was so special about the early
                PayPal team? #Question
              </li>
              <li>
                Thiel advocates that a startup should make recruiting fellow
                conspirators a core competency. Hiring should never be
                outsourced.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your hires should be like-minded people with similar interests
                and a passion about the problem domain you're working on.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a hire is forcing you to have a perk war, simply let them go,
                they are not passionate enough.
              </li>

                A startup is kind of like a cult, with less dogmatism. In order
                to foster a strong culture, pay attention to these 4 dimensions.

                Distribution of a product is as important as the product itself.
                Nerds and geeks are skeptical of salespeople, because from the
                outset it might seem superficial and irrational.
              </li>

                If you have invented something but you haven't figured out a way
                to distribute it, you have a bad business on your hands. You
                should treat distribution as a fundamental part of your
                business.

                Unlike his pal, Elon of PayPal, Thiel's outlook on AI is
                optimistic.

              <li>
                He believes man and machine have complementary skillsets and

                Consider the case of pattern recognition for instance, a 4 year

                If you don't have good answers to above questions, you'll run

            The Founder's Paradox
            <ul>
              <li>
                Startup founders tend to have extreme character qualities, this
                might be due to some form of law of attraction. If you have
                extreme character qualities you'll find yourself in the company
                of such people, which will further enhance those extreme
                qualities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Another interesting point Thiel makes about startup founders is
                not only they have extreme qualities; from the outset they might
                seem to possess very "opposite" type of traits as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                Founder's startup might be "valued" multiples of millions, but
                she might be living on a modest salary within a one bedroom
                apartment. So she might seem poor, but also rich depending on
                which angle you look.
              </li>
              <li></li>
              <li>
                Founders might seem poor and rich, genius and idiot or hero and
                villain at the same time. That's the paradox of being a founder.
              </li>
              <li>
                So be tolerant of the extreme qualities of founders, that's how
                they can lead companies beyond mere incrementalism.
              </li>
              <li>
                Single biggest danger for a founder is to become so certain of
                his own mythical qualities, he loses his mind.

            Conclusion: Extinction or Singularity
            <ul>
              <li>
                According to Thiel, there are only 2 possible options facing
                humanity.
              </li>
              <li>
                First option is that, we'll go into a horrible decline with the
                extinction of humankind from the face of earth. Global warming,
                populist politics, nuclear war, global famine are among the
                contenders for such a doomsday scenario.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second option is, the rate of advancement of technology will
                keep accelarating leading to an exponential take-off.
              </li>
              <li>
                My personal opinion is I would put my faith on the second
                option, that's the only outcome worth working for.
              </li>
